# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM
This project demonstrates a time-series prediction model for stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN). The model predicts future stock prices based on historical stock data, which is fetched using the yfinance library.
